 Tree pruning strategy

 Key observations:
 - the graph is a tree
 - we can prune off branches that don't contain Pok√©mon gyms/dragon (similar to CCC 2016 S3)

 The shortest path is done with one of the following methods, try both and get the minimum
 - Visit all nodes without dragon: 2*(P-1) - max_dist,
   where P is the number of nodes after pruning and max_dist is the farthest distance from node 1
 - With dragon: because the dragon lets you teleport to any visited node, you just get the dragon first and visit
   everything else like a dfs traversal, so you only go through each edge once
